### Introduction

The purpose of this project was to create the basic functionality of a nutrition tracking diary.<br> The nutritional information of foods can visualised in reference to an individual's Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) and added to a daily total.<br>This can be a useful tool for tracking calories, indentifying vitamin and mineral deficiencies or highlighting excessive intake of unhealthy nutrients such as saturated fat and sugar.

__Datasets__<br>
The nutrition datasets used in this project are in the public domain, taken from the U.S Deparment of Agriculture (USDA) available [here](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets.html).

The majority of RDIs were taken from a report by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, available [here](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/summary-report-of-the-dietary-reference-intakes). However amino acid RDIs were taken from a World Health Organisation report available [here](https://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/nutrientrequirements/WHO_TRS_935/en/) and
several nutrients not included in those reports such as alcohol and trans fats were taken from the NHS website available [here (alcohol)](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-support/calculating-alcohol-units/) and [here (fats)](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/different-fats-nutrition/)
