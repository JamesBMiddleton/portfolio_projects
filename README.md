# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of projects I have completed to demonstrate my understanding and application of various python packages commonly used in data-science. It includes examples of skills including data cleaning, data wrangling, visualisation, usage of fundamental statistical methods (difference and relationship testing) as well as building of machine learning models. All with the intention of extracting meaningful information from a dataset.

[Biomechanical differences between running footstrikes](https://github.com/JamesBMiddleton/portfolio_projects/blob/main/foostrike_biomechanics/Notebook.ipynb). Continuing the statistical analysis of a dataset made publicly available by Fukuchi et al. (2017) in a paper exploring the effect of velocity on running biomechanics. The notebook follows a similar format to a research paper, including an introduction, hypothesis, method, results and brief discussion of results.

[PLACES 2020 - Exploring 27 U.S. Health & Lifestyle measures](). Exploring the prevalence of various health and lifestyle measures across the U.S and building a multiple regression model to predict disease prevalence using common risk factors. 

[Building a K-nearest classifier from scratch](https://github.com/JamesBMiddleton/portfolio_projects/blob/main/k_nearest_classifier/notebook.ipynb). Explaining the theory and then building a train-test split function, normalisation function and K-nearest classifier class using numpy and random. Assessing the classifier's performance when predicting Iris species using petal and sepal width and length.

[Nutrition Tracker](https://github.com/JamesBMiddleton/portfolio_projects/blob/main/nutrition_tracker/Notebook.ipynb). Building the basic functionality of a nutrition tracking application, in which a dataset containing 500,000+ foods can be searched, nutritional information for a food can be visualised and then added to a daily total.
