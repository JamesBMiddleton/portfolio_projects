# Programming Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of projects I have completed to demonstrate my understanding and application of the Python programming language and a number of its essential packages. It includes examples of data cleaning, data wrangling, visualisation, usage of fundamental statistical methods (difference and relationship testing) and machine learning models, as well as the construction of GUI application.

[Nutrition tracking application](https://github.com/JamesBMiddleton/portfolio_projects/blob/main/nutrition_tracker/README.md). Building the basic functionality of a nutrition tracking GUI application using Pandas, Matplotlib and PyQt5. A dataset containing ~500,000 foods can be searched, nutritional information for a food can be visualised in reference to an individual's Recommended Daily Intakes (RDIs) and then added to a daily total.

[Building a K-nearest classifier from scratch](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesBMiddleton/portfolio_projects/blob/main/k_nearest_classifier/Notebook.ipynb). Explaining the theory and building a train-test split function, normalisation function and K-nearest classifier class using NumPy and random. Assessing the classifier's performance when predicting Iris species using petal and sepal width and length.

[PLACES 2020 - Exploring 27 U.S. Health & Lifestyle measures](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesBMiddleton/portfolio_projects/blob/main/places_2020/Notebook.ipynb). Exploring the prevalence of various health and lifestyle measures across the U.S and building a multiple regression model to predict disease prevalence using common risk factors. 

[Biomechanical differences between running footstrikes](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesBMiddleton/portfolio_projects/blob/main/footstrike_biomechanics/Notebook.ipynb). Continuing the analysis of a dataset made publicly available by Fukuchi et al. (2017) in a paper exploring the effect of velocity on running biomechanics. The notebook follows a similar format to a research paper, including an introduction, hypothesis, method, results and brief discussion of results.
