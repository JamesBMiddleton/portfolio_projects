# Programming Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of projects I have completed which demonstrate my understanding and application of various programming principles and practices. <br> The main programming languages used are C++ and Python. The main topics covered include fundamental program design in C++ and Python, GUI application design in Python as well as various aspects of data science and statistics using a number of Python packages.

## Contents
---

[Procedural ASCII tree generation](https://github.com/JamesBMiddleton/ASCII_tree). A C++ program which generates and animates the growth of tree-like structures in a terminal window using coloured ASCII characters.

[Nutrition tracking application](https://github.com/JamesBMiddleton/portfolio_projects/blob/main/nutrition_tracker/README.md). Building the basic functionality of a nutrition tracking GUI application using Pandas, Matplotlib and PyQt5. A dataset containing ~500,000 foods can be searched, nutritional information for a food can be visualised in reference to an individual's Recommended Daily Intakes (RDIs) and then added to a daily total.

[Building a K-nearest classifier from scratch](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesBMiddleton/portfolio_projects/blob/main/k_nearest_classifier/Notebook.ipynb). Explaining the theory and building a train-test split function, normalisation function and K-nearest classifier class using NumPy and random. Assessing the classifier's performance when predicting Iris species using petal and sepal width and length.

[PLACES 2020 - Exploring 27 U.S. Health & Lifestyle measures](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesBMiddleton/portfolio_projects/blob/main/places_2020/Notebook.ipynb). Exploring the prevalence of various health and lifestyle measures across the U.S and building a multiple regression model to predict disease prevalence using common risk factors. 

[Biomechanical differences between running footstrikes](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesBMiddleton/portfolio_projects/blob/main/footstrike_biomechanics/Notebook.ipynb). Continuing the analysis of a dataset made publicly available by Fukuchi et al. (2017) in a paper exploring the effect of velocity on running biomechanics. The notebook follows a similar format to a research paper, including an introduction, hypothesis, method, results and brief discussion of results.
